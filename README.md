The automatic understanding of lengthy documents (Long-context Document Understanding; DU) stands as a long-standing task in urgent and practical needs. Although many LVLMs now claim (and show promising cases) their capabilities on long-context DU, there lacks a unified and quantitative evaluation of existing models due to the absence of related benchmark.<br>
To bridge this gap, we construct <strong>MMLongBench-Doc</strong> which comprises 135 documents and 1091 qustions (each accompanied by a short, deterministic reference answer and detailed meta information.). The documents have an average of 47.5 pages and 21,214 tokens, cover 7 diverse domains, and are PDF-formatted with rich layouts and multi-modal components. The questions are either curated from existing datasets or newly-annotated by expert-level annotators. Towards a comprehensive evaluation, the questions cover different sources like text, table, chart, image, etc., and different locations (page index) of the documents. Notably, 33.0% questions are cross-page questions necessitating comprehension and reasoning on evidences across multiple pages. And 22.5% questions are designed to be unanswerable for reducing the shortcuts in this benchmark and detecting LVLMs' hallucinations.

## 📢 News
- 🚀 [07/2024] We further refine and update the questions in MMLongBench-Doc!
- 🚀 [07/2024] We have integrated MMLongBench-Doc to evaluation toolkit [VLMEvalKit](https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit), providing a highly convenient testing solution!
- 🚀 [06/2024] We upload MMLongBench-Doc to huggingface.

## 💡 Highlights
- 🔥 **Multi-modality**: All selected documents are PDF-formatted with rich layouts and multi-modal components including text, table, chart and image. We annotate questions carefully from these multi-modal evidences.
- 🔥 **Long-context**: Each document has an average of 47.5 pages and 21,214 tokens. Additionally, 33.0% of the questions are cross-page questions which necessitate the information collection and reasoning over multiple pages.
- 🔥 **Challenging**: Experiments on 14 LVLMs demonstrate that long-context document understanding greatly challenges current models. Even the best-performing LVLM, GPT-4o, achieves an overall F1 score of only 44.9%.

## Dataset
We save our benchmark, including both questions and documents, in `./data`.
* The questions are provided in json format and contain the following attributes:
```
    {
        "doc_id": "Independents-Report.pdf",
        "doc_type": "Research report / Introduction",
        "question": "What's the percentage of people who are democrats and voted in the last election compared to the entire population in 2018?",
        "answer": "18.29%",
        "evidence_pages": "[3, 5]",
        "evidence_sources": "['Pure-text (Plain-text)']",
        "answer_format": "Float",
    }
```
* The documents are saved in `./data/documents` as the format of PDF files.

You can also download this dataset by the following command (make sure that you have installed Huggingface Datasets):
```
from datasets import load_dataset
samples = load_dataset("yubo2333/MMLongBench-Doc/data")["train"]
```

## 🛠️ Usage
### Environment
```
python 3.9
2.1.2+cu121
```
You can install other dependencies by `pip install -r requirements.txt`.


### Quick Use
```
MODEL_NAME=[gpt-4o|gpt-4-turbo|gemini-1.5-pro-latest|internvl|4khd|minicpm_llama3] bash run.sh
```
Note that 
* `OPENAI_API_KEY` should be set no matter what models you are evaluating because we adopt a three-stage evaluation protocol as detailed in Section 4.1 of [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01523). The conversion from a long-form response to a short-form prediction necessitates GPT-4o's involving.
* We now support various popular open-source and closed-source LVLMs, including **GPT-4o**, **GPT-4V**, **Gemini-Pro-1.5**,**InternLM-Xcomposer2-4KHD**, **Intern-VL-Chat-v1.5** and **MiniCPM-Llama3-V2.5**. More LVLMs will be supported in the near future (we are cleaning related code).
